## 2026-09-18 — Backend core built (schema, locking, ledger, ingestion)

- `backend/` scaffolded: Fastify + TypeScript + `pg`, 7 reversible migrations covering the full schema in [[03-data-model]].
- ADR-001's lock mechanism ([[02-adr-001-fsn-level-locking]]) implemented as a single atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... WHERE expires_at < now()` in `lockService.ts`, fully audited via `fsn_lock_events`; a server-side `lockGuard.ts` enforces that only the current lock holder can open a locked FSN's darkstore list or submit against it.
- Ledger writes (`ledgerService.ts`) implement the atomic check-then-insert independently of lock state, plus idempotency-key dedup on `client_request_id` — verified this actually catches over-batching and safely no-ops a retried submission (integration tests written, gated on `TEST_DATABASE_URL` since no DB is provisioned yet — not run against a live Postgres in this session).
- Ingestion (`ingestionService.ts` / `ingestionValidation.ts`) follows [[04-ingestion-contract]]: file-level all-or-nothing on bad headers or >50% row failure, individual bad rows logged to `demand_exceptions` rather than dropped. Validation logic kept pure and unit-tested (10 tests, no DB needed).
- Verified: lint, typecheck, build, and unit tests all pass. **Not yet verified:** an actual migration run and integration-test pass against a real Postgres — no local Postgres/Docker available in this session, and no Neon connection string provisioned yet. Do this before considering the backend "working," not just "compiling."
- Uptime research: neither Neon nor Railway's default/starter tiers carry a real contractual uptime SLA — Neon's 99.95% SLA requires Business/Scale plan, Railway's contractual SLA requires Business Class/Enterprise. Flagged in [[05-deployment-runbook]] as an open plan-tier decision for a ₹450cr/year line.

## 2026-09-18 — Stack finalized: TS + Fastify, username/password auth, monitoring toolset

- Backend stack decided: Node.js + TypeScript + Fastify (up from PackTrack Pro's plain JS + Express) — see [[01-architecture]] "Deviations from PackTrack Pro." Reason: materially higher concurrency (100+ users) and correctness bar (₹450cr/year ledger) than PackTrack ever had.
- Labour login method decided: username/password for all roles (dropped the phone+OTP option considered in [[03-data-model]]).
- Monitoring toolset decided: **Sentry** (error tracking, both backend + frontends) + **Better Stack** (structured logs, uptime, alerting) — fills the Monitoring section in [[01-architecture]] that was previously TBD.
- **Microsoft Clarity considered and explicitly rejected** — session-replay/heatmap tooling doesn't fit an internal tool with known users, and conflicts with the labour app's offline/weak-wifi design and raises a consent question with no offsetting benefit. Full reasoning in [[01-architecture]].

## 2026-09-18 — Repo created, skeleton established

Decided repo name `ninjacart-shelf-batching` under `github.com/Jerseyno07`. Stack, schema, ADR-001 (FSN-level locking), and ingestion contract drafted for product review — see [[02-adr-001-fsn-level-locking]], [[03-data-model]], [[04-ingestion-contract]]. No feature code written yet; backend build starts once these are approved.
